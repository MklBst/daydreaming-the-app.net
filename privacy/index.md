# Privacy

Privacy in this experiment is naturally a sensitive theme. It's also very important for us to preserve it nonetheless.

## What does the app measure?

The app measures the following:

* Basic personal details (age, gender, psychological traits)
* The answers to the questions popping up every now and then
* Your coarse location (rough location through mobile network, not the GPS) when you're answering questions and also and regular intervals throughout the day. Location information remains coarse (the best possible precision is around 50 meters) since we're deliberately avoiding using the GPS.

## How anonymous will it be?

Completely anonymous. We will never ask you any information making it possible to identify you. We will never try to use your location data to try to infer anything about your identity.

## What will you do with our data?

We will only use your data for the purpose of our research. If we ever share your data, it will be in a completely anonymous (location free) and for research purposes. We will never use your data for commercial uses.

## Is all this legal?

Yes. Our research methodology and our use of your data complies with the ethical rules we must abide by in our research.
