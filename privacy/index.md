# Privacy

Privacy is a sensitive theme and it is very important for us to preserve it.

## What does the app measure?

The app measures the following:

* Basic personal details (age, gender, psychological traits)
* The answers to the questions popping up every now and then
* Your location at regular intervals throughout the day and when you're answering questions. Note that this location is collected through mobile network and is therefore not as precise as the GPS, that we're deliberately avoiding to use. Hence, your location is coarse, with a best precision around 50 meters.

## How anonymous will it be?

Completely anonymous. We will never ask you any information making it possible to identify you. We will never try to use your location data to try to infer anything about your identity.

## What will you do with our data?

We will only use your data for the purpose of our research. If we ever share your data, it will be in a completely anonymous manner (location free) and for research purposes. We will never use your data for commercial uses.

## Is all this legal?

Yes. Our research methodology and our use of your data complies with the ethical rules we must abide by in our research.
