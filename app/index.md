We are currently looking for users to try the application. Registration can be done through the dedicated google group that you may find by clicking on the Badge on the right. Please note that there is no iOS version, it is only for Android.

## Installing

Once you're in the [google-group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/daydreaming-beta-testers) and you have [accepted to be a tester](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.brainydroid.daydreaming), you may download the app from the playstore [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainydroid.daydreaming). The latter link will only work if you satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

## How does it work?

After a short introduction and a few preliminary questions, the app will be running. It contains:

* three psychological questionnaires that you can fill at any moment in the first three days. They aim at better undersanding your mental habits.
* a couple of questions every morning about your sleep quality. Does dream influence daydream?
* a couple of questions every evening about your free time. How does what you do in your free time influence your daydream?

Because... your mind is (probably) rich and complex, and many mundane things could have a surprising impact on it. Of course your mental habits, but also your sleep quality and how you spend your free time will be useful information to get a grasp on what makes your mental life so specific.

And crucially, the app also contains:

* the possibility to describe at any moment your thoughts
* daily notifications at random moments about the quality of your thoughts

Because... human’s thought is an ephemeral phenomenon. It is short-lived, and soon cleared from memory as you start attending to other things. The scientific study of thought has been challenging, but we now know that people’s descriptions of their thoughts are the most accurate when they are the most immediate.

Therefore, at any moment, you will be able to describe to the app your thoughts as you were just having them, whether daydreaming or not. Of course, you should not think too much about your thoughts! That is why, at random moments during the day, you will receive notifications asking you questions about your thoughts as you are having them – without anticipating the app.

## Why should I use it?

You're participating in a *research project* that might lead to very interesting discoveries in how the human mind works in everyday life. On top of that, you will be *immediately* able to:

* concretely pay attention to each of your own thoughts with the tools of science
* pay attention to specific behaviors and mental habits

*After 30 days*, to thank you for your helpful participation, you will also

* receive a detailed report of your real daydreaming style. With it you'll get a unique chance to notice regular and unexpected patterns of your mental functionning that appear only after dozens of observations have been collected.
* be able to share this report on your favorite social medias

*After 60 days*, once enough data will have been collected,

* you will finally reveive a comparison on how your daydreaming style differs from others.
* the app will keep on working. How does your daydreaming style changes with the day of the week, along seasons, if you start a new activity? You will be able to answer these questions by assessing your own data.

## Why use an app for this?

Classical experiments studying mindwandering involve having subjects come to a lab, waiting for them to mind wander and suddenly assessing the content of their thoughts (this is referred to as "thought sampling").

This app does the same thing except that subjects are now anyone using the app in their natural environment. This methodology will allow the assessment of mind wandering in an incredible variety of contexts and activities, and the collection of a large amount of *in vivo* data, impossible to obtain in a lab.

# Private beta

Since the app is still in testing phase there might be a few glitches here and there. Any crashes will be automatically reported to us, but if you have suggestions or remarks on how to improve things, we'd be <a href="mailto:feedback@daydreaming-the-app.net">delighted to hear from you</a>.

## Free software
