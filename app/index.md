# Get going now!

The latest version of the app is [available here](http://daydreaming-the-app.net/releases/daydreaming-0.8.1.apk). Alternatively you can scan this QR code which will bring you to the same link. Please note that there is no iOS version, it is only for Android.

## Installing

The app is in testing phase just before launching, which means it's not yet in the Google Play Store. So to install the file you just downloaded above, you must tell Android that this file is safe: go to your system settings, navigate to the *Security* section, and tick the *Unknown sources* checkbox.

You can then open the downloaded file (choose *Package Installer* if Android asks you which application to open the file with).

## Ready? Let's go!

After a few initial questions (bear with us!), you will see the main dashboard of the experiment. It tells you how many days you've been running the experiment for, and how long you have left before you can see your results.

The app will then start asking you some questions at random moments throughout your day (about 4-5 per day), while at the same time keeping a rough record of your position. Remember all this is absolutely anonymous! You can read more in the [Privacy](/privacy/) page.
