The latest version of the app is [available here](http://daydreaming-the-app.net/releases/daydreaming-latest.apk). Alternatively you can scan this QR code which will bring you to the same link. Please note that there is no iOS version, it is only for Android.

## Installing

The app is in testing phase just before launching, which means it's not yet in the Google Play Store. So to install the file you just downloaded above, you must tell Android that this file is safe: go to your system settings, navigate to the *Security* section, and tick the *Unknown sources* checkbox.

You can then open the downloaded file (choose *Package Installer* if Android asks you which application to open the file with).

## How does it work?

After a short introduction and a few preliminary questions, the app will be running and will start asking you questions about your current thoughts from time to time, while also keeping a rough record of your position. In some cases the questions will interrupt you in a mind-wandering episode and this is what we want. You can of course choose the time window when you want to be notified. During the first three days, you will also be able to complete three psychological questionnaires about your mental habits. Finally, every morning and every morning the app will ask you a couple of questions about your past night and your past day. 

## Why should I use it?

You're participating in a research project that might lead to very interesting discoveries in how the human mind works in everyday life. To thank you for your participation, we will generate a personalized feedback on many aspects of your own mental life. This feedback will be private, but you will be able to share it with whom you want. 

## Why use an app for this?

Classical experiments studying mindwandering involve having subjects come to a lab, waiting for them to mind wander and suddenly assessing the content of their thoughts (this is referred to as "thought sampling").

This app does the same thing except that subjects are now anyone using the app in their natural environment. This methodology will allow the assessment of mind wandering in an incredible variety of contexts and activities, and the collection of a large amount of *in vivo* data, impossible to obtain in a lab.
