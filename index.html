  <h1>Mind-wandering</h1>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The mind never stays still. Without constant vigilance our minds can, and often do, wander from the constraints of our current task to our own private thoughts and feelings. The experience of mind-wandering is one of the most introspectively accessible examples of the challenges of mental control.</p>
    <p>For example, everyone is familiar with the experience of suddenly realizing, while reading, that although one's eyes have continued to move across the page, one's mind has been fundamentally elsewhere.</p>

  <h2>The experiment</h2>

  <p>Nobody really understands how mind wandering occurs in everyday life, and yet between a third and a half of our time is spent mind wandering.</p>

  <p><em>Daydreaming</em> is an experiment for Android smartphones which aims at describing these precise conditions leading you to either mind wander or stay focused on what you are doing, by asking you every day a few questions about your thoughts, your sleep quality and your activities.</p>

  <p><em>Daydreaming</em> is also a pilot experiment in a larger endeavour to bring cognitive science into smartphones, making it easier for people to participate in exciting and cutting-edge brain research!</p>

  <h2>What's in it for you</h2>

  <p>Some speak to themselves. Others create mental images and sounds. Most people think they mind wander more than others. Many have noted that their daydreams are involuntary and often go unnoticed for a few seconds. And you? What kind of daydreamer are you? 
</p>

- Get to know your inner life better: its richness and the factors that have an impact on it.
- Help fundamental research on human consciousness by participating to an innovative experiment in a completely anonymised and secure way.
