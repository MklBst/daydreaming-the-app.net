  <h1>Mind-wandering</h1>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The mind never stays still. Without constant vigilance our minds can, and often do, wander from the constraints of our current task to our own private thoughts and feelings. The experience of mind-wandering is one of the most introspectively accessible examples of the challenges of mental control.</p>
    <p>For example, everyone is familiar with the experience of suddenly realizing, while reading, that although one's eyes have continued to move across the page, one's mind has been fundamentally elsewhere.</p>

  <h2>The experiment</h2>

  <p>Nobody really understands the role of mind-wandering, despite the fact that we spend over 50% of our time doing it.</p>

  <p><em>Daydreaming</em> is an experiment for Android smartphones which tries to better understand the <em>whys</em> and <em>hows</em> of this phenomenon. It is an app that maps your mind-wandering habits by asking you a few questions about your thoughts every day.</p>

  <p>It's also a pilot experiment in a larger endeavour to bring cognitive science into smartphones, making it easier for people to participate in exciting and cutting-edge brain research!</p>

  <h2>What's in it for you</h2>

  <p>You'll get to discover what your daily mind-wandering habits are, where and how you tend to disconnect into reverie more or less often, while at the same time helping an innovative experiment in a completely anonymised and secure way.</p>
