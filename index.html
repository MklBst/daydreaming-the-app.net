  <h1>Mind-wandering</h1>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The mind never stays still. Without constant vigilance our minds can, and often do, wander from the constraints of our current task to our own private thoughts and feelings. The experience of mind-wandering is one of the most introspectively accessible examples of the challenges of mental control.</p>
    <p>For example, everyone is familiar with the experience of suddenly realizing, while reading, that although one's eyes have continued to move across the page, one's mind has been fundamentally elsewhere.</p>

  <h2>The experiment</h2>

  <p>Nobody really understands how mind wandering occurs in everyday life, and yet between a third and a half of our time is spent mind wandering!</p>

  <p><em>Daydreaming</em> is an experiment for Android smartphones which aims at describing and understanding the richness of human mental life. By asking you every day a few questions about your thoughts, your dreams and your activities, this app tries to identify the various conditions leading you to either mind wander or stay focused.</p>

  <p><em>Daydreaming</em> is also a pilot experiment in a larger endeavour to bring cognitive science into smartphones, making it easier for people to participate in exciting and cutting-edge brain research!</p>

  <h2>What's in it for you</h2>

  <p>You'll get to discover how your sustained attention works, what your daily mind-wandering habits are, and to which conditions they are sensitive.
  At the same time you will help fundamental research on human consciousness by participating to an innovative experiment in a completely anonymised and secure way.</p>
