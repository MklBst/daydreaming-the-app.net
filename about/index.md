# About us

We are an international team of researchers from the UK, USA, Germany and France, interested in different areas of cognitive science.

This project has many facets:

* On the scientific side, Jonathan Smallwood, his students Florence Ruby and Haakon Engen (Leipzig, Germany) are experts in the study of mind wandering. This app adresses some open questions on the nature of this object of  their studies.
* On the technical side, Vincent Adam (London, UK), Sebastien Lerique (Berlin, Germany) are very interested in the exploratory use of new ways to gather in vivo data through new technologies.
* One a larger scale, the joint analysis of large datasets in the psychology field is a key interest of Tal Yarkoni (Boulder Colorado, USA), who recently created his Lab in the emerging field of Psychoinformatics.
