# About us

We are a team of researchers from the UK, Germany and France interested in different areas of cognitive science.

This project has many facets:

* On the scientific side, [Jérôme Sackur](http://www.lscp.net/persons/sackur/) and his PhD student [Mikael Bastian](http://mikaelbastian.weebly.com/) are experts in the study of mind wandering. This app adresses questions on the mechanisms underlying our ability to daydream. They work at the [Ecole Normale Superieure](http://www.ens.fr) in Paris (France)
* On the technical side, [Vincent Adam](http://ucl.academia.edu/VincentADAM) and [Sebastien Lerique](https://mehho.net/sl/) are very interested in the exploratory use of new ways to gather in vivo data through new technologies. Vincent works at [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in London (UK) and Sebastien at the [Centre Marc Bloch](http://www.cmb.hu-berlin.de/en/) in Berlin (Germany)

This app is developed in the context of the project [Science en Poche](http://www.iscpif.fr/tiki-index.php?page=SEP) that aims to promote and ease the development of mobile applications for scientific purposes.
Science en Poche is hosted at the [Complex Systems Institute](http://www.iscpif.fr/tiki-index.php?page=home) headed by [David Chavalarias](http://chavalarias.com/) and is funded by the city of Paris.
The app wouldn't be that nice without the help of our designer [Gislain Delaire](http://cargocollective.com/gislaindelaire).
