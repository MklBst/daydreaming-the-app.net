Daydreaming

The app that wanders with your mind


////DayDreaming App

Welcome to the Homepage of the DayDreaming App Experiment

This app brings psychological research in the field of mindwandering out of the lab and directly into your pocket in a very easy way. Using apps for our research opens a wide new range of exciting opportunities for us, among which the possibility to directly share our research and results with anyone having a smarphone (Hopefully you!).

With this app, you can participate in a scientific field experiment in a totally anonymous and secure way. Personal results will be accessble directly on your phone. The average results from users around the world will be diplayed on this web page.

What you can do with it:
1) Learn a lot about yourself
2) Take part in this field experiment and help us find out more about how the brain works

Daydreaming

The app that wanders with your mind



/////DayDreaming App


How does it work?

After a short introduction and a few settings, the app is running and will from time to time generate a notification asking you to answer a set of questions related to your actual thoughts. In some cases, the notification will interrupt one mind wandering episode and this is what we want. You can of course choose the time window when you want to be notified.

Why should I use it?

Two main reasons to use the app.

You participate in a research project that might lead to very interesting discoveries.
From the data we collect from you, we will generate a personalized feedback on many aspects of your daily mental life.
We will also provide some general feedbacks throught this website.

What is it for?

The DayDreaming App aims to study how your mind wanders. Mindwandering occurs more than 50% of your time during a day, but no one really understands its role.
The particular interest of this experiment is to assess the impact of one’s direct environment on its mind wandering (location, weather, time in the day etc).

Why using an app?

Classical experiments to study mindwandering involve having subjects coming to a lab, letting them wander and suddenly assessing the content of their thoughts (this is referred to as “thought sampling”).
This app will do the same thing except that subjects are now anyone using the app in their natural environment. This methodology will lead to a large amount of data in vivo, which is not possible to get in a lab.

Privacy

What will we measure/save?

We will

save some basic personal details (age, gender, …)
save the answers you provide at each notification
record your coarse location (rough location through mobile network) at the time you submit your answers and also at some random moments in the day.
How anonymous will it be?

Totally anonymous. We will never ask you any information making it possible to identify you.
We will never try to use your location data to try to infer anything about your identity.

What will you do with our data?

We will only use your data for the purpose of our research.
If we ever share your data, it will be in a completely anonymous (location free) and for research purposes.
We will never use your data for commercial uses

Is all this legal?

Yes. Our research methodology and our use of your data complies with the ethical rules we must abide by in our research work.

About us

We are an international team of researchers in different fields of cognitive science.
This project has many facets:

On the scientific side, Jonathan Smallwood, his students Florence Ruby and Haakon Engen (Leipzig, Germany) are experts in the study of mind wandering. This app adresses some open questions on the nature of this object of  their studies.
On the technical side, Vincent Adam (London, UK), Sebastien Lerique (Paris, France) are very interested in the exploratory use of new ways to gather data in vivo through new technologies.
One a larger scale, the joint analysis of large datasets in the field psychology is a key interest of Tal Yarkoni (Boulder Colorado), who recently created his Lab in the emerging field of Psychoinformatics
We started a fruitful collaboration that lead to the development of this app.
