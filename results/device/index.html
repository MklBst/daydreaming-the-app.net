    <h1>Results</h1>
    <!--<a id="switch" href="#">Global <-> personal</a>-->
    <p>Lucky you! You get to see the global results we analysed before everyone else.</p>
    <p>Thanks for being a beta tester!</p>

        <h2>Global results</h2>
        <p>On average, people mind-wander a lot: over 40% of their time.</p>
        <h3>Weekly rhythms</h3>
        <p>Mind-wandering depends on the day of the week. See the mind-wandering peaks on Mondays and Fridays!</p>
        <div id="focus_weekly_rythms"></div>
        <h3>Know yourself</h3>
        <p>People are usually aware of their mind-wandering 49% of the time. But they can be more or less aware of it &mdash; see how much.</p>
        <div id="mindwandering_awareness"></div>
        <h3>Words or images? Maybe sounds</h3>
        <p>Most people think a lot in words. See how this changes depending on whether people are mind-wandering or not.</p>
        <div id="words_and_sounds"></div>
        <h3>Surroundings</h3>
        <p>People's awareness of their surroundings is pretty much independant of where they are...</p>
        <div id="awareness_of_surroundings_location"></div>
        <p>... but it sure depends on how many people are around! The more people around, the greater the awareness, except when we're alone or in a crowd.</p>
