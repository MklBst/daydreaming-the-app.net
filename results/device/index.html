    <p>Lucky you! You get to see the global results we analysed before everyone else.</p>
    <p>Thanks for being a beta tester!</p>

        <h2>Global results</h2>

        <p>On average, people mind-wander a lot: over XX% of their time.</p>

        <h3>Weekly rhythms</h3>
        <p>Mind-wandering or being focussed depends on which day it is! See how focussed people are throughout the week.</p>
        <img class="static-plot" alt="Bar plot of focus vs. day of the week" src="">

        <h3>Know yourself</h3>
        <p>People are usually aware of their mind-wandering XX% of the time. But they can be more or less aware of it &mdash; see how much.</p>
        <img class="static-plot" alt="Pie plot of awareness of mind-wandering" src="">

        <h3>Words or images? Maybe sounds</h3>
        <p>People generally think a lot in XXXX. See how this changes depending on whether people are mind-wandering or not.</p>

        <h3>Surroundings</h3>
        <p>People's awareness of their surroundings varies depending on where they are...</p>
        <img class="static-plot" alt="Bar plot of awareness of surroundings vs. location" src="">
        <p>... but also depending on how many people are around. The more the people around, the XXXX (sharper/lower) the awareness!</p>
